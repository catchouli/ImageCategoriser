## ImageCategoriser

A lightweight image categoriser written in python. Categorises images and stores a config file in the folder.

To use it you have to (currently) edit the top of the script and change the folder to watch. At some point I'll add support for monitoring multiple folders or at least selecting one.

Install with pip:
- PyQt5
